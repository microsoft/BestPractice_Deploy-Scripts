.SYNOPSIS
    Deploys the Microsoft Purview Best Practice baseline for Microsoft 365
    Business Premium tenants.

.DESCRIPTION
    Single entry point that orchestrates the full deployment based on the
    Microsoft "Data Security Best Practice Deployment" guide for Business
    Premium. The toolkit is modular — every task is an independent script
    under .\Modules and can be run standalone.

    Tasks (in order):
      1. Tenant settings        — audit log, AIP/SPO integration, PDF labels,
                                  co-authoring (and optional container labels
                                  + premium audit)
      2. Sensitivity labels     — Personal, Public, General, Confidential
                                  (with AllEmployees sub-label),
                                  Highly Confidential — encryption applied,
                                  ordered, and published with General as the
                                  default
      3. DLP                    — separate Exchange and SPO+OneDrive policies
                                  blocking external sharing of the
                                  Confidential\AllEmployees label
      4. Retention              — Exchange mailbox 7-year retain-then-delete
      5. AI governance          — Microsoft 365 Copilot DLP policies
                                  (e.g. AI_054 - Block Copilot for Highly
                                  Confidential). Default ON for E5 / Purview
                                  Suite tenants; auto-skipped on Business
                                  Premium ($BPOnly). Opt out with
                                  -SkipAIControls.

    Default mode = APPLY changes. Pass -WhatIf for preview, or -Confirm for
    per-action confirmation prompts.

.PARAMETER TenantAdminUpn
    UPN of the tenant administrator (or partner GDAP admin) used for sign-in.

.PARAMETER SharePointAdminUrl
    Optional override for the SharePoint admin centre URL
    (e.g. https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com). When omitted, the URL is
    auto-derived from the tenant's initial onmicrosoft.com domain after
    Exchange Online is connected. Use this parameter only when auto-derivation
    fails (e.g. multi-geo or unusual domain configurations).

.PARAMETER DelegatedOrganization
    Customer tenant primary domain when running as a partner via GDAP.

.PARAMETER ConfigPath
    Path to a custom PurviewConfig.psd1. Defaults to .\Config\PurviewConfig.psd1.

.PARAMETER SkipTenantSettings
    Skip foundational tenant settings (audit, SPO integration, co-authoring).

.PARAMETER SkipLabels
    Skip sensitivity-label creation and publishing.

.PARAMETER SkipDLP
    Skip DLP policy creation.

.PARAMETER ApplyRetention
    Provision the Exchange mailbox retention policy from
    PurviewConfig.psd1. **Opt-in** — retention does NOT run by default
    because the shipped 7-year retain-then-delete default is destructive
    (deletes mail older than 7 years tenant-wide) and is wrong for some
    regulated verticals (law / accounting / healthcare / financial
    advisors / construction / real estate). The partner must consciously
    choose a duration for the customer's vertical before enabling.
    See docs/Retention-Default-Risk.md.

.PARAMETER SkipAIControls
    Skip the AI governance / Microsoft 365 Copilot DLP policy step. By
    default, AI governance runs on every E5 / Purview Suite deployment
    because the policy plane is included in those SKUs and the protection
    (blocking Copilot from grounding on Highly Confidential content) is the
    same risk class as Endpoint DLP. AI governance is auto-skipped on
    Business Premium tenants ($BPOnly) regardless of this switch.

    Per Microsoft Learn, the policy enforces against both paid Microsoft
    365 Copilot and the free Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat experience, so
    creation succeeds on E5 / Purview Suite tenants even when no paid
    Copilot per-user licenses are present.

    See: https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/dlp-microsoft365-copilot-location-learn-about

.PARAMETER ApplyAIControls
    DEPRECATED. AI governance is now provisioned by default (see
    -SkipAIControls). Passing this switch emits a deprecation warning and
    is otherwise ignored. Cannot be combined with -SkipAIControls. Kept
    for backward compatibility with existing partner runbooks; will be
    removed in a future major version.

.PARAMETER EnableContainerLabels
    DEPRECATED. Container labels (Group.Unified EnableMIPLabels) are now
    provisioned by default (the toolkit's licensing floor is Microsoft 365
    Business Premium, which includes Entra ID P1 — the AAD-side
    requirement). See -SkipContainerLabels to opt out. Passing this switch
    emits a deprecation warning and is otherwise ignored. Cannot be
    combined with -SkipContainerLabels. Kept for backward compatibility
    with existing partner runbooks; will be removed in a future major
    version.

.PARAMETER SkipContainerLabels
    Opt out of container labels (Group.Unified EnableMIPLabels) for
    Microsoft 365 groups, Teams, and SharePoint sites. Use this only when
    container labels are managed by another process (e.g. an existing
    Conditional Access / sensitivity-label rollout owned by the customer
    or another partner), or on a sub-Business-Premium tenant that lacks
    Entra ID P1. License auto-detect also flips this on automatically
    when the tenant has no recognised Microsoft 365 BP / E5 / Purview
    Suite SKU.

.PARAMETER EnablePremiumAudit
    Also enable per-mailbox SearchQueryInitiated audit. Requires Audit
    (Premium) licensing.

.PARAMETER PremiumAuditMailbox
    Mailbox UPN(s) on which to enable SearchQueryInitiated audit.

.PARAMETER AdoptExisting
    Update labels, policies, and rules that already exist but were not created
    by this toolkit. Use only after auditing existing configuration.

.PARAMETER EnableLabelCoAuthoring
    OPT-IN tenant-wide switch. Calls `Set-PolicyConfig -EnableLabelCoauth:$true`
    in Setup-TenantSettings step [4/5]. THIS IS A ONE-WAY CHANGE: once
    enabled, sensitivity-label metadata moves out of the old custom-properties
    location to the new embedded location. Disabling it later (PowerShell
    only — the Purview portal does NOT support disabling) REMOVES the new-
    location metadata; unencrypted Word/Excel/PowerPoint files lose their
    labels entirely. Any third-party app, scanner or script that reads
    labels from the old location will break: AIP scanner < v3.0, OneDrive
    sync < 19.002, MIP SDK < 1.7, custom DLP scanners, custom Exchange
    mail-flow rules, etc. Off by default because partners cannot
    enumerate every third-party integration on a customer tenant. Confirm
    no old-location consumers exist before passing this switch.
    Ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/sensitivity-labels-coauthoring

.PARAMETER NonInteractive
    Skip the preflight confirmation prompt (e.g. for CI/automation runs).
    Also skips the post-connect tenant-identity confirmation prompt. If the
    connected tenant's verified domains do NOT include the expected domain
    (from -DelegatedOrganization or the -TenantAdminUpn suffix), the script
    aborts with a hard error BEFORE any destructive change.

.PARAMETER AutoInstallModules
    Auto-install any missing PowerShell modules (ExchangeOnlineManagement,
    Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell, Microsoft.Graph.*) to the current
    user scope without prompting. Without this switch you are prompted before
    each install.

.PARAMETER NoLicenseAutoDetect
    Disable automatic license-tier detection. By default the script connects to
    Microsoft Graph, reads /subscribedSkus, and (a) skips AI governance when no
    Microsoft 365 E5 / Purview Suite SKU is detected, and (b) skips container
    labels when no Microsoft 365 BP / E5 / Purview Suite SKU is detected.
    Pass this switch to skip detection (e.g. when running unattended in a
    tenant where the operator does not have Organization.Read.All consent).

.PARAMETER BPOnly
    Hard-restrict the toolkit to Microsoft 365 Business Premium-eligible
    features only. Refuses to enable add-ons that require Microsoft 365 E5 /
    Microsoft Purview Suite licensing:
      * Premium Audit / 1-year retention (-EnablePremiumAudit)
      * Endpoint DLP (Devices), DLP for Defender for Cloud Apps,
        on-premises DLP scanner, Power BI DLP
    Container labels (Group.Unified EnableMIPLabels) are NOT in this list —
    they work on Business Premium because BP includes Entra ID P1 (the
    AAD-side requirement). Pass -SkipContainerLabels if you need to opt out.
    Also propagates to the DLP module so any custom workload added to
    PurviewConfig.psd1 that requires E5 is rejected up-front.

.PARAMETER DeploymentPlanPath
    Optional path for the pre-connection Deployment Plan HTML file. The JSON
    sidecar uses the same basename. By default both files are written to the
    caller's working directory.

.PARAMETER NoDeploymentPlan
    Suppress the offline Deployment Plan. This does not suppress the end-of-run
    deployment report. Plan generation is best effort and never blocks service
    connection when a local rendering or file-write error occurs.

.EXAMPLE
    # Standard partner-managed customer onboarding — SharePoint admin URL is
    # auto-derived from the tenant's initial domain.
    .\Deploy-PurviewBestPractice.ps1 -TenantAdminUpn admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com

.EXAMPLE
    # Preview every change without applying
    .\Deploy-PurviewBestPractice.ps1 `
        -TenantAdminUpn admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -WhatIf

.EXAMPLE
    # GDAP partner-delegated scenario, with retention opt-in
    .\Deploy-PurviewBestPractice.ps1 `
        -TenantAdminUpn partneradmin@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com `
        -DelegatedOrganization contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -ApplyRetention

.EXAMPLE
    # Override the auto-derived SharePoint admin URL (rare — multi-geo/vanity)
    .\Deploy-PurviewBestPractice.ps1 `
        -TenantAdminUpn admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -SharePointAdminUrl https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com

.NOTES
    * Required modules: ExchangeOnlineManagement,
      Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell, and
      Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement (skipped only when
      -SkipContainerLabels or -SkipTenantSettings is used).
    * Label and policy changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate.
    * Always pilot in a test tenant before production rollout.

    [$tickDlp] DLP policies       (Exchange + SPO/OneDrive)
    [$tickRetention] Retention          (Exchange 7 years — opt-in via -ApplyRetention)
    [$tickAi] AI governance      (Block Copilot grounding on Highly Confidential — default on; opt out: -SkipAIControls; auto-skipped on Business Premium)

  Optional features:

    [$tickPremium] Premium audit    (SearchQueryInitiated)

    [$tickLabelCoAuth] Label co-auth tenant switch (ONE-WAY — see -EnableLabelCoAuthoring help)

  Legend: 'X' = task is in scope and will run.  ' ' = task is skipped (by user opt-out or BP auto-skip).
          '?' = task pending license auto-detect — runs if tenant has E5 / Purview Suite, otherwise auto-skips.
