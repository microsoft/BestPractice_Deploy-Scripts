.SYNOPSIS
    Shared transient-error retry helper for the Purview Best Practice toolkit.

.DESCRIPTION
    Microsoft 365 backends (IPPS / Security & Compliance, EXO, SPO, Graph
    Beta directory settings) regularly return short-lived 5xx and throttling
    responses during bulk policy/label/rule operations:

      * 429 throttling under burst writes (label priority reorders, rule
        creation loops)
      * 502 / 504 gateway responses while a long-running provision is still
        in flight server-side
      * 500 / "server side error" on freshly-hydrated tenants or during
        Microsoft maintenance windows
      * 503 "Service Unavailable" during regional service incidents

    Without retry, a single transient hiccup mid-deploy leaves a tenant in
    a half-configured state (e.g. policy created but rule missing). With
    retry, the same hiccup is silently absorbed after a short backoff.

    EXPORTS (via dot-source):
      * Test-TransientServerError   - signature detector
      * Invoke-WithTransientRetry   - retry wrapper

    Auto-imports theyes Tier-2 run log helper (PurviewRunLog.ps1) when
    present, so the wrapper can emit Started / Retried / Succeeded /
    Failed entries for every retry-wrapped destructive op without the
    caller doing anything. Setup-* modules that dot-source this file
    therefore get the Add-RunLogEntry function automatically as well.

.NOTES
    Origin: extracted from Setup-TenantSettings.ps1 where this pattern was
    first proven, and promoted into a shared module so Labels, DLP,
    Retention, and AI Governance can use the same backoff and signature
    set. (Jim's PR4 feedback.)

    Usage:
        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Invoke-WithTransientRetry.ps1')

        Invoke-WithTransientRetry -Description 'New-DlpComplianceRule X' -Action {
            New-DlpComplianceRule -Name 'X' -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
        }
#>

# Auto-import the Tier-2 run log helper so callers (Setup-* modules)
# get Add-RunLogEntry in their scope. Idempotent: if PurviewRunLog.ps1
# is missing (e.g. unit-test rigs that mock it out), we silently skip
# and Invoke-WithTransientRetry falls back to no-op logging via
# Get-Command detection inside the retry loop.
$_purviewRunLogPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'PurviewRunLog.ps1'
if (Test-Path $_purviewRunLogPath) {
    . $_purviewRunLogPath
}

function Test-TransientServerError {
    <#
        Returns $true when the error blob carries any of the well-known
        transient signatures emitted by IPPS/EXO/SPO/Graph. The check is
        substring-based across the full error record (message, details,
        category, FQEID, exception type name) because each service tends
        to surface the same condition through slightly different fields.

        Important: HTTP 500 + "Internal Server Error" alone is NOT enough
        to classify as transient -- IPPS wraps several deterministic
        semantic errors (e.g. InvalidSubLabelPriorityException) in a
        generic 500 envelope. We check a non-transient denylist FIRST and
        bail out before the transient pattern match if any matches.

function Test-AlreadyExistsError {
    <#
        Detects "object already exists" style errors. Used by the retry
        wrapper when -AlreadyExistsIsSuccess is set: if a New-* cmdlet
        succeeded on the server but failed on the response handshake, a
        retry will see the object already there and would normally throw
        — we treat that case as success (because it IS success, just
        invisible to the client on the first attempt).

        Caveat: on attempt #1 a pre-existing object is a real condition
        the caller should know about, so the wrapper only suppresses
        already-exists from attempt #2 onward.

function Invoke-WithTransientRetry {
    <#
        Execute -Action; on a transient error, sleep and retry up to
        -MaxAttempts times. Non-transient errors throw immediately.

        Backoff schedule defaults to 5s -> 15s -> 30s -> 45s -> 60s.
        Total ceiling at default settings: ~155 seconds before giving up.

        Returns whatever -Action returns (so Get-* calls can be wrapped
        without their output being clobbered). On giving up (transient
        errors that outlast MaxAttempts, OR a non-transient error),
        re-throws so the caller's catch fires normally.

        -AlreadyExistsIsSuccess: opt-in flag for idempotent New-* paths.
            If retry sees an "already exists" error on attempt #2+, treat
            as success (the object was created by a prior failed attempt
            whose response we lost). On attempt #1, "already exists" is a
            real condition and propagates normally.

        -OnRetry: optional scriptblock invoked between sleeps. Used by
            callers that need to refresh stale state (e.g. re-read a
            label's Priority before the next Set-Label attempt).

        -Module / -Target: optional run-log enrichment. When the Tier-2
            PurviewRunLog is loaded (Add-RunLogEntry available), the
            helper auto-emits Started / Retried / Succeeded / Failed
            entries so every retry-wrapped destructive op shows up in the
            end-of-run HTML report without the caller having to do
            anything. Logging is silently skipped when Add-RunLogEntry
            isn't available (e.g. in standalone unit tests).
