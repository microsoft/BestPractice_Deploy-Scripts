    # Encryption / protection
    # -----------------------
    # Template-protected labels (HC \ All Employees, HC \ Internal Exception)
    # grant the configured rights bundle to ALL USERS IN YOUR TENANT ONLY —
    # not external authenticated identities from other Microsoft 365 tenants.
    # The toolkit auto-resolves your tenant's verified domain at runtime and
    # substitutes it into `EncryptionRightsDefinitions` (see comment at that
    # field below for the token syntax and fallback behaviour).
    #
    # UserDefined-protected labels (both Specific People sub-labels) let the
    # user pick the recipients and permissions at apply time. Outlook
    # behaviour is "Do Not Forward"; Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
    # prompt the user to assign permissions.
    #
    # The default Template rights bundle is Microsoft's "Reviewer" set:
    # users get View, View Rights, Edit Content, Save, Reply, Reply All,
    # Forward. Co-authoring (auto-save + simultaneous editing in Office)
    # and macros / programmatic access via the Office object model are NOT
    # included by default, because OBJMODEL access is the main vector by
    # which third-party apps reading doc metadata break under encryption.
    #
    # If you need a wider rights bundle (e.g. Copy, Print, Allow Macros for
    # third-party tooling), edit `EncryptionRightsDefinitions` below
    # directly — typically by appending `,EXTRACT,PRINT,OBJMODEL` to the
    # `{TenantDomain}:` rights string. Validate in a pilot tenant before
    # rolling out, since OBJMODEL access affects every third-party app that
    # reads Office document metadata.
    #
    # Auto-labeling (client-side and service-side) is intentionally NOT
    # configured here. Add it deliberately via the Purview portal once your
    # team has reviewed false-positive risk and user-impact trade-offs.
    #
    # Sub-label Name uniqueness
    # -------------------------
    # IPPS requires every label `Name` (the internal identifier) to be unique
    # across the tenant. Because Microsoft's defaults reuse display names like
    # "All Employees" under multiple parents, we prefix each sub-label Name
    # with its parent (e.g. `HCAllEmps`). The `AllEmployees` Name on
    # Confidential is preserved unchanged so existing DLP rules with
    # `LabelPath = 'Confidential/AllEmployees'` keep resolving.
    #
    # Label color
    # -----------
    # Each label has an optional `Color = '#RRGGBB'` hex string. The toolkit
    # applies it via `New-Label`/`Set-Label -AdvancedSettings @{color=...}`
    # so the colour shows up next to the label in Office and Purview. Defaults
    # below mirror Microsoft's recommended palette (green=Public, blue=General,
    # amber=Confidential family, red=Highly Confidential family). Sub-labels
    # inherit their parent's family colour. To disable, remove the `Color`
    # entry — the toolkit will leave the label's current colour unchanged.
