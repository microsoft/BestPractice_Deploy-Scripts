# SMB Best Practice Tool

PowerShell automation that configures Microsoft 365 tenants against
Microsoft's recommended best-practice baselines for **Small / Medium**
customers. Built for repeatable, idempotent configuration of Microsoft 365
tenants — by partners/MSPs and in-house IT teams alike.

> ⚠️ **Always pilot in a test tenant before applying to production.** Many
> changes are tenant-wide and can take up to 24 hours to fully propagate.

## Common prerequisites (all toolkits)

Each toolkit documents its own detailed prerequisites. Common requirements
across all of them:

* **PowerShell 7+** (`pwsh.exe`) to **run** the toolkits — the deploy
  scripts hard-fail on Windows PowerShell 5.1 because the Exchange
  Online v3 REST channel and Microsoft.Graph SDK depend on .NET Core
  APIs that PS 5.1 doesn't expose. Install with
  `winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell` or from
  <https://aka.ms/PowerShell-Release>.
* **Windows** host with PS 5.1 still present — the
  `Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` module is Windows-only and
  is loaded automatically via `Import-Module -UseWindowsPowerShell`
  (a hidden PS 5.1 sub-process) so its bundled MSAL DLL never enters
  PS 7's AppDomain. macOS and Linux are not supported.
* **Tenant admin credentials** with the appropriate role(s) for the
  product being deployed (see each product's page for the exact role map).
* **Required PowerShell modules** — the toolkits auto-detect missing
  modules and offer to install them from PSGallery on first run. Pass
  `-AutoInstallModules` to install silently.
