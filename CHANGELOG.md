# Changelog
{: .no_toc }

All notable, **operator-facing** changes to the SMB Best Practice Tool are
recorded here — new features, changed defaults, fixes, and anything that
affects how you run the toolkit or what lands in a customer tenant.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## How versions work here

This is an operations toolkit organised around **products** — a product is a
tenant-facing workload with its own deployment path (e.g. `[Purview]`). SemVer
(`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) is read against those products:

| Bump | Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | A **new product** is added to the toolkit — a new tenant-facing workload with its own deployment path. | Adding Defender alongside Purview. |
| **MINOR** | A **new feature, switch, or a redesign _within_ an existing product** — backward compatible for whoever runs it. | A new optional `-Switch`; the sensitivity-label signature redesign. |
| **PATCH** | A **bug fix** with no behaviour change for correct usage. | A connect/auth reliability fix. |

> A **changed default** (e.g. a switch that flips off→on, or a new tenant-side
> effect) does **not** by itself force a MAJOR bump — it rides the MINOR/PATCH of
> the product it belongs to — but it is **always** called out under **Changed**
> so operators see it.

Each entry is grouped under **Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed /
Security**, and tagged by area (e.g. `[Purview]`, `[Site]`). Changes that have
landed but not yet been tagged in a release appear under **Unreleased**.

> 🛠 **Maintainer note.** This is the *operator-facing* counterpart to the
> internal `Skills/` decision logs (which capture the *why* in detail). Keep
> entries short and operator-focused: "what changes when I run this." When you
> cut a release, rename `Unreleased` to `vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` and create the
> matching git tag / GitHub Release.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-01

> **Note — significant redesign (within Purview).** This reworks Purview sensitivity-label
> management to adopt Microsoft's built-in taxonomy by its stable signature, create MS-exact
> labels on blank tenants, and support the modern label scheme. It is a substantial redesign
> but stays within the existing Purview product, so it ships as a **MINOR** bump
> (`1.2.0`), not `2.0.0`. MAJOR (`2.x`) is reserved for adding a **new product** (e.g. Defender).

### Added

- **[Purview] Region- and scheme-proof label adoption + creation via the Microsoft
  `defa4170` signature.** Built-in labels are now identified by their stable internal
  `defa4170-…` name instead of the (localized) display name, so adoption works identically
  on English/French/German/… tenants and on both classic and modern label schemes. On
  blank tenants the toolkit now *creates* labels with the same `defa4170` names, so they are
  byte-identical to Microsoft's defaults (multitenant tools that look up by the standard
  name work everywhere).
- **[Purview] Blank modern-scheme tenant support.** Parents that own sub-labels are created
  as label **groups** (`-IsLabelGroup`) on modern-scheme tenants, with automatic fallback to
  a classic parent on classic tenants. Previously, deploying to a *blank* modern tenant
  failed creating sub-labels with `InvalidParentLabelInModernLabelSchemeException`.
- **[Purview] "Inherit label from attachments" is on by default.** Label policies now set
  `AttachmentAction = Automatic`, so an email inherits the highest-priority label from its
  attachments. Set `LabelPolicy.AttachmentAction` to `'Recommended'` (prompt) or `$null`
  (off) in `PurviewConfig.psd1` to change it.

### Changed

- **[Purview] Sensitivity-label taxonomy aligned to the Microsoft built-in defaults.**
  Confidential publishes **All Employees** + **Trusted People**; Highly Confidential
  publishes **All Employees** + **Specific People**; **General** is now a label **group**
  with **Anyone (unrestricted)** + **All Employees (unrestricted)**. The custom
  `Specific People` (under Confidential) and `Internal Exception` sub-labels are removed and
  consolidated into Trusted People / Specific People. **⚠️ On tenants where a previous
  version already created those extra sub-labels, they become unmanaged — delete them in
  Purview Admin.**
- **[Purview] Email default targets the assignable `General\Anyone (unrestricted)` leaf**
  (General is now a non-applicable group).
- **[Purview] Soft-delete tombstone rename no longer adds ` v2` to the user-visible
  DisplayName.** When a ~30-day tombstone blocks a re-created label, only the internal name
  is versioned; the DisplayName stays clean (a tombstone does not reserve the DisplayName).

### Fixed

- **[Purview] No more 45-second false "IPPS propagation" waits** when resolving already-
  existing (adopted) labels — they resolve on the first pass, and `-WhatIf` never waits. A
  `-WhatIf` that previously idled ~14 minutes now runs straight through.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **[Purview] Modern label-scheme publishing.** On tenants migrated to the
  modern sensitivity-label scheme, the toolkit now detects label **groups** (a
  parent that has sub-labels becomes a non-publishable container) and publishes
  only their sub-labels — the service auto-includes the parent group. It also
  substitutes a group used as the document or email default with the
  appropriate child (e.g. the Outlook default falls back from `General` to
  `General\Anyone (unrestricted)`), and excludes auto-managed group entries
  from the label-policy diff so re-runs stay idempotent. **Classic-scheme
  tenants are unchanged.** Previously, deploying to a modern-scheme tenant that
  already had the Microsoft built-in labels failed to publish with
  `Label group(s) ... can not be published`.

### Fixed

- **[Purview] No longer aborts on a localized display-name collision.** When a
  configured sub-label's display name matches an existing label's *localized*
  name under the same parent (e.g. `Specific People` vs the built-in
  `Specified People`), the toolkit now adopts the existing label instead of
  failing `New-Label` — which previously cascaded into a hard
  `Sensitivity label ... not found` stop in the DLP step.
- **[Purview] Policy default label resolves when it is an adopted sub-label.**
  Fixes `Default label 'AllEmployees' was not found after creation` on tenants
  where the default sub-label was adopted from a pre-existing built-in label
  (its live internal name is a GUID, not the configured name).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

**Initial versioned release.** This establishes version tracking; `1.0.0` is a
concise baseline snapshot of the toolkit as it stands today. Granular pre-1.0
development history is intentionally **not** itemised here — see the
[merged pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/BestPractice_Deploy-Scripts/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged)
and [commit log](https://github.com/microsoft/BestPractice_Deploy-Scripts/commits/main)
for the detail. From the next release onward, every change is listed under its
own version above.

### What's in the box

- **[Purview] Data Security baseline** — idempotent, re-runnable deployment of
  tenant settings, sensitivity labels (encryption + container scope), DLP, and
  optional retention, all driven from one config file (`PurviewConfig.psd1`).
- **[Purview] License-aware** — auto-detects Business Premium vs E5 / Purview
  Suite and applies what the licence supports (E5 / Purview Suite additionally
  gets Endpoint DLP and AI governance / Copilot DLP).
- **[Purview] Zero-Trust connect** — Graph-first auth, WAM broker, and
  automatic recovery from common MSAL / `Microsoft.Graph.Beta` module issues.
- **[Site] Documentation site** — this GitHub Pages site: deployment framework,
  support-team guide, configuration reference, change-management timeline,
  adoption guide, and scenarios reference.

### Safety defaults

- **DLP starts in simulation** — zero user impact on day 0; promote after a
  Day-30 review.
- **Destructive / irreversible actions are opt-in** — retention
  (`-ApplyRetention`) and label co-authoring (`-EnableLabelCoAuthoring`);
  `-BPOnly` hard-blocks E5-only features.
- **Every run produces an HTML + JSON report** (secrets stripped) recording
  what ran, was skipped, or failed.

> **Upgrading from an earlier (untagged) build?** `-EnableContainerLabels` and
> `-ApplyAIControls` are now deprecated no-ops — both behaviours are default-on.
> Use `-SkipContainerLabels` / `-SkipAIControls` to opt out.
